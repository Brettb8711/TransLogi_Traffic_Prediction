# TransLogi: Logistics Optimization System

## Overview
TransLogi is a comprehensive logistics optimization system designed to improve delivery operations for TransLogi, a logistics company. The system integrates real-time data, machine learning, and route optimization to provide actionable insights and optimize resource utilization. This project focuses on building a fully functional, containerized web application that showcases:

- **Delivery Time Prediction**: Leveraging machine learning models to estimate delivery times for new orders.
- **Route Optimization**: Implementing algorithms to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), considering constraints like traffic, weather, vehicle capacity, and delivery time windows.
- **Monitoring and Visualization**: Providing a dashboard with real-time operational metrics and map-based route visualizations.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Deploying the solution using Docker for accessibility and scalability.

## Goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Goals
1. **Optimize Delivery Operations**:
   - Reduce average delivery times.
   - Improve vehicle utilization rates.
   - Minimize fuel consumption and delivery costs.

2. **Enhance Decision-Making**:
   - Provide real-time insights into delivery operations.
   - Enable dynamic adjustments to routes based on live data.

3. **Deliver a User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Create an interactive dashboard for easy monitoring.
   - Visualize optimized routes and operational metrics.

4. **Ensure Scalability and Reliability**:
   - Build a modular, containerized application.
   - Enable seamless deployment on cloud platforms or local environments.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Delivery Time**: Measure the average time taken to complete deliveries.
- **Route Efficiency**: Evaluate the reduction in total travel distance and time.
- **Vehicle Utilization**: Track the percentage of vehicle capacity used per trip.
- **Cost Savings**: Assess the reduction in fuel and operational costs.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Calculate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **System Uptime**: Monitor application availability and reliability.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Integrates traffic (Google Maps API), weather (OpenWeatherMap), and logistics transaction data into a relational database.
- **Data Engineering**: Automates data cleaning, feature engineering, and storage processes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning models to predict delivery times based on historical and real-time data.
- **Route Optimization**: Solves VRP with constraints for dynamic routing.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays real-time metrics, trends, and optimized routes on an interactive map.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Includes Dockerized components for backend, frontend, and database.
